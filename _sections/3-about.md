# Who Am I?

Iâ€™m a senior with 5+ years of experience tutoring math. Some things I enjoy outside of school are reading, and writing for my [blog](https://world.hey.com/talia){: .on-yellow}. I've also hosted a 40-episode podcast about business and personal finance called [Money Moves for Teens](https://pglevy.github.io/mm4t-site/){: .on-yellow}. I think math is an important subject because it can be applied to other areas of life like personal finance, art, and design.
