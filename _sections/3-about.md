# Who Am I?

Iâ€™m a junior who has been in Prince William County Public Schools since second grade. Some things I enjoy outside of school are listening to podcasts and writing for my [blog](https://world.hey.com/talia){: .on-yellow}. I think math is an important subject because it can be applied to other areas of life like personal finance, art, and design.
