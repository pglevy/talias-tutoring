# Who Am I?

Iâ€™m a tenth grader who has been in Prince William County Public Schools since second grade. Some things I enjoy outside of school are playing music and working on my podcast, [Money Moves for Teens](https://moneymovesforteens.weebly.com/){: .on-yellow}. I think math is an important subject because it can be applied to other areas of life like personal finance, art, and design.
