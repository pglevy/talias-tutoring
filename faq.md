# How does this work?

How do I schedule a session?
: Contact me using the form below and tell me about what topic you want your child to focus on. I will get back to you to discuss scheduling. In general, I'm available on weekdays in the afternoon.

How will we meet?

: A computer (laptop preferred), pencil, and paper.

What grades do you tutor?
: 5th through 8th grades

How much is it and how do I pay?
: An hour-long session is $20. Payment is accepted through Zelle or PayPal.
